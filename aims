kernel-pca:-
    gaussian function (different sigma)
    polynomial (different degree)
pca
1-NN classifier using euclidean distance:-
    number of sample images per person
    number of components in kernel-pca

Three - Experiments:
    Taking 1 image of each subject and performing further
    1) Using Gaussian kernel-pca, Varying value of kernel width(best = 3000) and number of components(best=30, 10  or 20 are fine).
    2) Using polynomial kernel-pca, varying the degree(better lower example best 2) of polynomial and number of features(20 or 30 are good enough
    3) using PCA , number of principal components (best 30)

Final experiment:
    Comparing both pca and kernel-pca, varying number of images per person used for training
